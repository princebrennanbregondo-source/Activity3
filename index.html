  <p>
    They say we all have that one moment that cuts deeper than steel. For me, it wasn’t fate, it wasn’t destiny — it was a single right-click.  
    <br><br>
    I’m Prince Brennan Bregondo, 18, walking the halls of the University of Cebu – Main Campus, BSIT-J. This path wasn’t my parents’ choice, it wasn’t even mine.  
    But the world forced my hand, and I carved it open myself.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>The Spark</h2>
  <p>
    At 9, lost in Roblox, I right-clicked. “Inspect.” The void cracked open. Code — raw, merciless.  
    <br><br>
    I didn’t understand, but I knew one thing: if the world was built on this, then I’d wield it like a blade.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>The Weight</h3>
  <p>
    IT wasn’t a dream. It was a burden — heavy, sharp, and mine to carry. While others saw a career, I saw a battlefield of logic, firewalls, and endless nights.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h4>The Hunt</h4>
  <p>
    Programming, networking, databases, cybersecurity — they’re not just subjects. They’re scars, each one carved deeper as I grind toward mastery.  
    I’m not here for grades. I’m here to sharpen my blade.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h5>The Code I Bleed</h5>
  <p>
    Knowledge isn’t comfort. Knowledge is a weapon. In a world that tears you apart, I’ll forge my code to strike back.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h6>Eyes on the Void</h6>
  <p>
    The nights will break me. The bugs will mock me. The failures will haunt me.  
    <br><br>
    But I’ll keep moving. Because I’m not here to play safe. I’m here to struggle, to bleed, to carve my mark.  
    <br><br>
    This isn’t the end. It’s the first swing.
